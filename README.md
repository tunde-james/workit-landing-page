## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I would focus more on understanding the Positional Layout, and get better at using position property with the different values available.

I would also explore CSS Grid in my next project, as well as accessibilty for screen readers.

### Useful resources

- [css for js developers](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js/02-rendering-logic-2/01-positioning) - This helped me with understanding the position layout.
